## üîç Key Steps in the Notebook

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Replaces blank strings in `TotalCharges` with `0`
- Converts `TotalCharges` to float
- Checks for and handles missing or duplicate values
- Converts `SeniorCitizen` from 0/1 to "No"/"Yes"

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Basic statistical summary using `describe()`
- Distribution of churn vs. non-churn using bar plots
- Checks for duplicates in `customerID`

### 3. Visualization
- Bar plots to analyze churn distribution
- (Optional) You can extend the notebook to include:
  - Churn by tenure or contract type
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Pie charts or histograms for services usage
